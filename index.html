  <h1>Application 6 Live Demo</h1>

  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 30px;">
    This project is a safety control panel developed by for a theme-park ride systems company to monitor
ride speed and handle emergency stop conditions in real time. The controller constantly samples speed,
detects unsafe conditions, and immediately responds to brake input by switching to an emergency state
and activating visible warnings. Real-time operation is essential because any delay in processing safety
events could put riders at risk. Deterministic task scheduling and guaranteed response times are therefore
required for safe and reliable system operation
